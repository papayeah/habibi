                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>Built for the Bold and Future73 are campaigns celebrating Timberland's legacy of craftsmanship and triumph during its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The team took on the challenge of expanding Timb's demographic scope and iconography in the minds of its people. From the narrative down to the last curve, we emboldened each detail.

                    <h5>Role</h5>
                    <p>My role as the motion graphics specialist was to create a library of reusable motion components for the brand, which could be picked up by anyone. First you're introduced to the brand's foundation. As I worked, I thought about embedding a bold motion which could be distinct to Timberland's identity.</p>
