                    <p>Built for the Bold and Future73 are campaigns celebrating Timberland's legacy of craftsmanship and triumph during its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The team took on the challenge of expanding Timb's demographic scope and iconography in the minds of its people. From the narrative down to the last curve, we emboldened each detail.

                    <h5>Role</h5>
                    <p>My role as the motion graphics specialist was to create a library of reusable motion components for the brand, with non-designers in mind. First you're introduced to the brand's foundation. As I worked, I thought about embedding a bold motion which could be distinct to Timberland's identity.</p>

                    <h5>components</h5>
                    <p>Followed by the brand's foundation, reusable components which live in social media with Timberland's signature motion language were created. Timberland, Timberland 50, Future73 were each destinations arrived to by the brand's familiar tree icon and wordmark. As brands compete with each other, using distinct motion speaks to the hearts of its consumers.</p>
