                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>INDUSTRY is a global strategy and creative agency located in Portland, co-founded by Oved Valadez—the subject in this vignette. Grit and intensity highlight the principles of the agency and its integrity.

                    <h5>Role</h5>
                    <p>Emphasising this grit through distortion, saturation, and glitching; the team chose to accentuate the Oved's narrative. I was responsible for the conclusion of the video played behind him, presenting our tagline in fashionable glitch: "We believe in better."</p>

                    <p>As always, much research and development was given to finding an appropriate glitch. The effect has become the dead horse with which designers beat and claim originality. I watched the popular videos, explored my own visual library, and studied old technology—all within the neat timeline of two hours.</p>
