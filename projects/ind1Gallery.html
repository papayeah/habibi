                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                        <p>INDUSTRY, a Portland-based design agency, developed a community-driven gallery space for local artists: <a href = "https://industry1.org/gallery/" target = "_blank">ONE.</a> In addition to being commission free, its goal is to highlight non-traditional artists, serve their audiences, and foster a city common place.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Role</h5>
                        <p> Alongside the internal design team, I created motion assets for the brand and subsequent exhibits. The challenge was to create items which spoke in each artists' tone and lived in the agency's brand language. Each solution lives across social media campaigns, email blasts, and press.</p>

                    <h5>sentiments exhibit with it's a living + madsteez</h5>
                    <p>This seasoning found its way into Sentiments, a crossover between two distinct artists and their processes. The entire gallery became their canvas. This bursting energy and flavour needed to invite the audience in—with simple clarity. The motion language combined the deconstructed theme of the exhibit with the classic ONE speed and spice.</p>

                    <p>On the contrary, Follow Your Light became a flowerbed for reflection and experience. Analogising stories as portals and describing the fluid nature of life through "the power of intergenerational healing, visioning, and poetry." The circle and its components became visual accents alongside the smooth transitioning from one moment to the next.</p>
